## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Jira Cloud account
- An API token from Atlassian

### Generate Jira API Token

1. Go to [https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens)
2. Click "Create API token"
3. Label your token (e.g., "Jira Planner")
4. Copy the token - you'll need it for setup

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:5173`

### Usage

1. **Connect to Jira**:
   - Enter your Jira domain (e.g., `yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
   - Enter your email address
   - Enter your API token
   - Click "Connect"
   - Credentials are saved - you'll auto-connect on future visits

2. **Select Project & Board**:
   - Choose a project from the dropdown
   - Select a board
   - Pick a sprint, or select "All Sprints (Past, Current & Future)"

3. **View Issues**:
   - **Kanban Board**: View issues by status (default)
   - **All Issues**: Click "All Issues" button for table view with filters

4. **Filter Issues** (All Issues view):
   - Use the filter panel to narrow down issues
   - Multiple filters can be combined
   - Filters are reflected in the URL for sharing

5. **Manage Tags**:
   - Click on the Tags cell in any row to add/remove tags
   - Tags are stored locally only

6. **Save Views**:
   - Configure your desired columns and filters
   - Click "Save View" to store the configuration
   - Load saved views later for quick access

## URL Routing & Parameters

The app uses hash-based routing for shareable URLs:

```
#/board                              - Kanban board view
#/all-issues                         - All Issues table view
#/all-issues?customer=Acme           - Filtered by customer
#/all-issues?status=In%20Progress    - Filtered by status
#/all-issues?fixVersion=v1.0         - Filtered by fix version
#/all-issues?tag=urgent              - Filtered by tag
#/all-issues?assigneeId=xxx          - Filtered by assignee
```

Multiple filters can be combined:
```
#/all-issues?customer=Acme&status=In%20Progress&status=To%20Do&fixVersion=v2.0
```

**Bookmark or share these URLs** - they preserve your view and filters on page refresh.

## Data Storage

### IndexedDB (Local Data)
All Jira data is stored locally in browser IndexedDB:
- Projects, Boards, Sprints
- Issues with all fields
- Users (for display names)
- Tags (your personal tags)
- Saved Views

**Data is read-only from Jira** - no changes are written back to Jira.

### LocalStorage (Settings)
- Jira credentials (domain, email, API token)
- Last selected board/sprint

## Sync Behavior

- **Initial Connect**: Full sync of all projects, boards, sprints, and issues
- **Page Refresh**: Incremental sync (last 30 days of updated issues)
- **Manual Sync**: Click "Sync" button to force refresh data from Jira

## Custom Fields

The app extracts data from custom fields:
- **customer**: `customfield_10043` (array or string)
- **product**: Any custom field containing "product"
- **qa_tester**: Any custom field containing "qa" or "tester"

## API Integration

This app uses the Jira Cloud REST API (read-only):

- **Authentication**: Basic Auth with email + API token
- **Agile API**: For boards, sprints, and board issues
- **REST API v3**: For issues and projects

### Key Endpoints

- `GET /rest/api/3/myself` - Get current user
- `GET /rest/api/3/project` - List projects
- `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board` - List boards
- `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board/{id}/sprint` - List sprints
- `GET /rest/agile/1.0/board/{id}/issue` - Get board issues

## Security Notes

- Credentials are stored in browser localStorage
- All Jira data is stored in browser IndexedDB
- The app runs entirely in your browser - no data is sent to third parties
- Never commit your API token to version control

## Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev      # Start dev server

# Production
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to connect to Jira"
- Verify your Jira domain (should be `xxx.atlassian.net`)
- Check that your API token is valid
- Ensure your account has access to the Jira instance

### "No boards found"
- Make sure you have a Scrum or Kanban board configured in Jira
- Check that your account has board permissions

### Issues not loading
- Open browser console for error messages
- Verify the selected board has issues
- Check network tab for API response errors

### Customer filter not showing values
- Ensure `customfield_10043` exists in your Jira instance
- Trigger a manual sync to refresh the data
- Check browser console for sync logs

### View resets to Kanban board on refresh
- Check that the URL contains `#/all-issues` or filter parameters
- The app should restore your last view based on the URL
